		<h2>About</h2>

		<p>
			Phy project is a basic language to simplify creation and control of physics engine on three.js project. Phy make bridge from three to physics in worker or directly.<br>
			All engine is compact in one file with embed wasm and worker<br> 
			This is the compilation of all my physics work experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			Phy provide same command for all physics engine.<br>
			But each engine have is own feature.

				[link:https://github.com/saharan/OimoPhysics/ OIMO] is only javascript code; is light, stable and speed for simple project.
			</li>
			<li>
				[link:https://rapier.rs/ RAPIER] is simple, stable and speed for complete project.
				
			</li>
			<li>
				[link:https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js AMMO] is wasm port of Bullet engine, is powefull but old. Use for complex game.
			</li>
			<li>
				[link:https://github.com/fabmax/physx-js-webidl PHYSX] is wasm port by fabmax of Nvidia Physx engine, is the most recent and powerful. It's one of the fastest and have very stable joint for robotics.
